## 🎬 A Polymorphic Playground of Digital Files

Welcome to **MediaVerse Simulator** — an interactive, object-oriented media adventure coded in Python! This system brings digital files to life using classic OOP principles like **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** — but with a twist of personality.

At its core lies the **`MediaFile`** abstract class — the universal blueprint for all media. From it, four diverse subclasses spring into action:

- 🎵 **`AudioFile`** – Simulates playing audio tracks and lets you crank up the volume.
- 🎥 **`VideoFile`** – Streams video playback with optional subtitle magic.
- 🖼️ **`ImageFile`** – Allows viewing and resizing images like a digital Picasso.
- 🕹️ **`HypermediaFile`** – Turns your terminal into a mini game hub with **Tic-Tac-Toe** and **Rock-Paper-Scissors**!

Each class implements its own flavor of the `operate()` method — proving that one method can wear many hats 👒🎩🧢 thanks to **polymorphism**.


> Whether you're learning OOP or building a Python class hierarchy project, this simulator offers a clean, creative, and extensible design.

## 🕹️ How to Run the Program
Welcome to **MediaVerse** — a command-line playground for exploring digital media! 🧠💻  
No need to set up a GUI or install fancy tools — just launch the Python file and dive in.

### 🚦 Step-by-Step Simulation Flow

1. **Start the Program**
   
   Run the script in your terminal or Python environment

2. **Choose Your Media Adventure**
   
   You'll be greeted with this interactive menu:

    ``` (no tag)
    🎉 Welcome to MediaVerse: Media File Simulator!
    Choose a media type:
    1. Audio
    2. Video
    3. Image
    4. Hypermedia (Games)
    5. Exit

3. **Interact with Your Choice**

   Depending on what you choose, you’ll be prompted to:

       ✓ Input details (filename, artist, resolution, etc.)
       ✓ Perform actions (play, view, resize, or even play games!)
       ✓ Decide if you'd like to ⭐ add the file to your Favorites list.
